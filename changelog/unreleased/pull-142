Bugfix: Fix possible data loss due to interrupted network connections

When rest-server was run without `--append-only` it was possible to lose uploaded
files in a specific scenario in which a network connection was interrupted. For the
data loss to occur a file upload by restic would have to be interrupted such that
restic notices the interrupted network connection before the rest-server. Then
restic would have to retry the file upload and finish it before the rest-server
notices that the initial upload has failed. Then the uploaded file would be
accidentally removed by rest-server when trying to cleanup the failed upload.

This has been fixed by always uploading to a temporary file first which is moved
in position only once it was transfered completely.
